Part 1
The Cognitive Revolution


I. An Animal of No Significance.
* The big bang happened 13.5 Million years ago. Matter, energy, time and space came into being. This begins the story of Physics
* 300,000 years later, Matter and energy coalesced into complex structures called atoms, which then combined to form molecules. This begins the story of Chemistry
* 3.8 Million Years ago. On the planet Earth, Molecules combined to form organisms. This begins the story of Biology. Animals much like modern humans appeared 2.5million years ago.
* 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo Sapiens formed structures called cultures. This begins the story of History. There are three important revolutions that have shaped history:
    * The Cognitive Revolution - 70,000 years: when homo sapiens developed the ability to talk about things that they can not see. They developed the ability to share common myths, gossip, share information not relating to their immediate surroundings.
    * The Agricultural Revolution 12,000 years: when homo sapiens learned about farming and taming animals.
    * The Scientific Revolution 500 years ago: 
* Biologists classify organisms into species. Animals belong to the same species if they are able to mate with each other and produce fertile offspring. We are Homo Sapiens. (the species Sapiens of the genus Homo).
* Genera are then grouped into families. Homo Sapiens belong to the Great Apes family. Our closest living relatives are chimpanzees, gorillas, and orang-utans. All members of a family can trace their lineage back to a single matriarch or patriarch.
* 6 million years ago, A female ape had two daughters, One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is a grandmother we all share. 
Skeletons in the Closet
* Why are we the only extant members of our genus remaining? We may be the reason behind the demise of our cousins.
* The other species of the Homo genus; Neanderthalis, Erectus, Soloensis, Floresiensis, Denisovan, Rudolfensis, Ergaster.
* We have modestly named ourselves Homo Sapiens, Wise Man
* 2 million years ago, the Earth was home to several different human species. The fact that we are the only ones remaining may be somewhat incriminating.
The Cost of Thinking
* Our brains account for 2-3% of our body weight, yet we consume around 25% of our energy to use it.
* This increased energy usage required more food and diverted energy from muscles. 
* We don’t know why we evolved this way for more than 2 million years.
* Having a large brain does not mean that the animal is smarter. Neanderthals had larger brains than us, frogs and cats have relatively large brains compared to their bodies.
* Humans walk on two feet, freeing up the use of our arms for tools. Childbirth became more dangerous as an upright gait required narrower hips. Women gave birth earlier. Humans are born quite prematurely.
* Being born prematurely compared to other animals, means that a human must be taken care of until it is fully grown. A Human is helpless in it’s early years. For a child to grow, it must be taken care of, by it’s mother, father, and tribe. Thus, evolution favoured those who were able to form strong social bonds
* Despite the evolution of our brains, humans were right in the middle of the food chain. We hunted smaller animals and gathered, avoiding predators and sucking bone marrow from the leftover corpses of the prey of our predators.
* It was only recently that we shot up to the top of the food chain. This has led to an imbalance. Usually this change happens slowly, allowing nature to develop checks and balances. If a lion hunts a gazelle, the gazelle evolves to be faster. 
* Humankind has shot up tot he top so quickly that the ecosystem has not been given time to adjust. We are full of fears and anxiety of our position, which makes humans cruel and dangerous.
A Race of Cooks
* 800,000 years ago some human species may have made occasional use of fire. it was not until 300,000 years ago when Homo Erectus, Neanderthalis and Sapiens were using fire on a daily basis.
* With fire came a source of light and warmth, and a defence against prowling predators. 
* Most importantly, fire gave us the ability to cook food. This opened up foods that were previously not digestible in the natural forms. Foods such as wheat rice and potatoes became staples of our diet because of cooking.
* Cooking killed germs and parasites and made it easier for us to digest food. Chimpanzees may spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, whereas a single hour suffices for cooked food.
* This advent of cooking allowed us to devote less time to eating and make do with shorter intestines. Allowing us to divert the energy to our brains.
* Fire gave us control over nature that no other animal possesses. Animals may take advantage of natural forces, but this all comes down to the strengths and designs of their bodies. Whereas with our domestication of fire, we gained control of a potentially limitless force, the power of which was not limited by the form or strength of our own bodies. A single human with a fire could burn down an entire forest in a matter of hours.
Our Brother’s Keepers
* 150,000 years ago, humans were still marginal creatures. Most scientists agree that at this time Homo Sapiens were already present on the world stage, minding its business in a corner of Africa. We don’t know when Homo sapiens first evolved. If one of them turned up in a modern morgue, they would look just like us. Thanks to fire and cooking, they had smaller teeth and jaws than their ancestors, but similar brain sizes to ours.
* 70,000 years ago, sapiens spread from East Africa. 
* There are two competing theories that explain what happened to the other prominent Homo species when Homo Sapiens first arrived in Eurasia.
* Interbreeding Theory: As Homo Sapiens spread into Eurasia, they bred with other human species. For example, there were neanderthals in europe before sapiens arrived. sapiens bred with neanderthals until the two populations merged. A similar thing would have happened with the homo erectus in asia. Who we are today is the outcome of this interbreeding. 
* Replacement Theory: According to this theory, sapiens and other humans have different anatomies, mating habits and even body odours. They would have had little sexual interest with one another. Additionally, this theory proposes that if the two species mixed they would not be able to have fertile children because the genetic differences between the two species was unbridgeable. When the other species died off, their genes died with them. If this is true then all sapiens lineage can be traced back to africa 70,000 years ago.
* The Replacement theory had been the common wisdom in the field. It had firmer archaeological backing and was more politically correct.
* In 2010, a 4 year effort to map the Neanderthal genome were published. The results stunned the scientific community. It turns out that 1-4% of the DNA of modern populations of the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. Another shock came when results that mapped Denisovan DNA showed up to 6% of modern human DNA of Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians is Denisovan DNA.
* If these results are valid - further research is still being conducted which may reinforce or modify conclusions - The interbreeders may be somewhat right.
* There must have been a point where different human species were able to breed and produce fertile offspring with each other. Then another mutation occurred, severing the last connecting thread. It appears that on rare occasions, we were able to mate with other human species.
* How did the other human species vanish? One possibility is that sapiens drove the other species to extinction. Thanks to our efficiency in hunting and gathering, better technology and social skills. sapiens were able multiply and take over lands belonging to other species. The other species found it increasingly difficult to sustain themselves and died out.
* Another possibility is a darker one. Perhaps competition for resources flared into violence and genocide.
* Imagine how the world would turn out if Denisovans and Neanderthals had survived with us. How different would the world be? Homo sapiens have grown accustomed to being the only human species it’s hard for us to conceive of any other possibility. When Charles Darwin indicated that Homo sapiens were just another kind of animal, people were outraged.
* Whether we are to blame or not, no sooner had we arrived to a place the native population became extinct. 
* Homo solensis 50,000 years ago. Homo denisova shortly after. Homo Neanderthalis 30,00 years ago. Homo floresiensis 12,000 years ago. Leaving nothing behind but tools, a few genes in our DNA and us. Homo sapiens.
* What was the secret to the success of Homo sapiens? How did we manage to settle in so many distant and ecologically different habitats? The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible. Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.
II. The Tree of Knowledge
* Somewhere between 70,000-35,000 years ago, sapiens developed their unique ability. Our language.
* There are two theories. Lion over by the water, or Gossip theory, that drove the evolution of language.
    * Lion
    * Gossip
* Other animals have their own languages, however Sapiens are the only species that is able to communicate about things that do not exist. This ability to talk about fictions is what enables Sapiens to believe in common myths, stories, and that the lion prowling the nearby grasses is actually a guardian spirit.
* Using this language we are able to cooperate with others on a massive scale. Whilst other animals also cooperate with each other, they have limitations.
    * Bees and Ants work with each other on a large scale, however only in a rigid manner and with those they close with.
    * Chimpanzees and Wolves work with each other on a smaller scale, and also only with those they are close with.
    * Sapiens, are able to work flexibly with strangers on a almost limitless scale. Sapiens can form cultures, countries, and follow laws, believe in religions and different philosophies.
